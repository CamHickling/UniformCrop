# UniformCrop
crops images to specific dimensions while centering the object within the frame

STEPS:
1. First, check your dependencies and use pip to install the ones you don't have. This script works in py 3.8.10 and will likely work in other versions of Python as well.   
2. Read through the main py file and change the lines marked with '!!!' to suit your needs according to page size, naming conventions and crop preferences
3. Make a folder containing all of the images ready to be processed in the folder named "input"
4. Run in your IDE or via the terminal
